# Lead Scoring Model Card

**Version:** v1-20251221-b374197e  
**Date:** 2025-12-21  
**Status:** Production Ready

---

## Model Overview

This model predicts the probability that a lead will convert to a "Call Scheduled" stage within 30 days of initial contact. The model uses XGBoost with probability calibration to provide calibrated probability scores.

### Model Type
- **Algorithm:** XGBoost (Gradient Boosting)
- **Calibration Method:** Isotonic
- **Features:** 12 features

## Key Features

### Top 5 Predictive Features

1. **current_firm_tenure_months** - Primary signal
2. **days_in_gap** - Secondary signal
3. **firm_net_change_12mo** - Tertiary signal
4. **firm_rep_count_at_contact** - Additional signal
5. **industry_tenure_months** - Additional signal

### Business Hypotheses Validated

- ✅ **Mobility Hypothesis:** Advisors with frequent firm changes are more likely to convert
- ✅ **Employment Gap Hypothesis:** Advisors in transition periods are more receptive
- ✅ **Bleeding Firm Hypothesis:** Advisors at unstable firms are more likely to convert

## Usage

### Score Interpretation

- **0.0 - 0.3:** Low probability (Cold)
- **0.3 - 0.5:** Medium probability (Warm)
- **0.5 - 0.7:** High probability (Hot)
- **0.7 - 1.0:** Very high probability (Very Hot)

### Recommended Actions

- **Very Hot (0.7+):** Call immediately
- **Hot (0.5-0.7):** Prioritize in next outreach cycle
- **Warm (0.3-0.5):** Include in standard outreach
- **Cold (<0.3):** Low priority

---

## Limitations

1. **Class Imbalance:** 4.2% positive rate requires careful threshold tuning
2. **Temporal Validation:** Model trained on Feb-Oct 2024, tested on Nov 2024
3. **Feature Dependencies:** Some features depend on FINTRX data availability
4. **Calibration:** Probabilities are calibrated but may drift over time

---

## Maintenance

- **Retrain Frequency:** Quarterly
- **Monitoring:** Track conversion rates monthly
- **Alert Threshold:** If top decile lift drops below 2.5x
