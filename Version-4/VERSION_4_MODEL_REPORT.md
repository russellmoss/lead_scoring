# Version 4 Lead Scoring Model - Final Report

**Model Version**: 4.0.0  
**Deployment Date**: 2025-12-24  
**Status**: Production (Hybrid Deployment)

---

## Executive Summary

The V4 XGBoost Lead Scoring Model is deployed as a **deprioritization filter** to identify leads that should be skipped or contacted last. While V4 does not outperform V3 on top decile lift (1.51x vs 1.74x), it provides significant value by identifying the bottom 20% of leads that convert at only 1.33% (vs 3.20% baseline).

### Key Findings

- **Bottom 20% Conversion**: 1.33% (0.42x lift, 58% below baseline)
- **Top 80% Conversion**: 3.66% (1.15x lift, 14% above baseline)
- **Efficiency Gain**: Skip 20% of leads, lose only 8.3% of conversions = **11.7% efficiency gain**
- **Use Case**: Deprioritization filter (skip bottom 20-30% of leads)

## Deployment Strategy: Hybrid Approach

### Primary Use: Deprioritization Filter

| Action | V4 Score | Leads | Expected Conv | Recommendation |
|--------|----------|-------|---------------|----------------|
| **Skip** | Bottom 20% | 1,200 | 1.33% | Don't contact |
| **Deprioritize** | 20-30% | 600 | ~2.0% | Contact last |
| **Standard** | 30-80% | 3,000 | ~3.5% | Normal priority |
| **Prioritize** | Top 20% | 1,200 | ~4.5% | Contact first |

### Combined with V3

```
Lead Scoring Pipeline:
1. V3 Rules → Assign Tier (T1, T2, T3, T4, Standard)
2. V4 Score → Assign Percentile (1-100)
3. Final Priority:
   - V3 T1-T2 AND V4 top 50% → HIGHEST PRIORITY
   - V3 T1-T2 AND V4 bottom 50% → HIGH (but verify)
   - V3 Standard AND V4 bottom 20% → SKIP
   - V3 Standard AND V4 top 20% → UPGRADE to medium
```

### Expected Business Impact

| Scenario | Leads Contacted | Conversions | Efficiency |
|----------|-----------------|-------------|------------|
| **No model** | 6,004 | 192 | Baseline |
| **V3 only** (top decile) | 600 | ~33 | 1.74x lift |
| **V4 filter** (skip bottom 20%) | 4,803 | 176 | +11.7% efficiency |
| **Hybrid** (V3 + V4 filter) | ~4,800 | ~170+ | Best of both |

## Production Deployment

### SQL Components

1. **View**: `ml_features.v4_production_features`
   - Calculates all features for current leads
   - Uses `CURRENT_DATE()` as prediction date
   - PIT-compliant (only uses data available at prediction time)

2. **Table**: `ml_features.v4_daily_scores`
   - Caches feature values for scoring
   - Refreshed daily (recommended: 6 AM EST)
   - Includes metadata (scored_at, model_version)

### Python Components

1. **Scorer Class**: `inference/lead_scorer_v4.py`
   - `LeadScorerV4`: Main scoring interface
   - `score_leads()`: Generate predictions
   - `get_percentiles()`: Calculate percentile ranks
   - `get_deprioritize_flags()`: Identify leads to skip

### Salesforce Integration

**New Fields**:
- `V4_Score__c`: Raw prediction (0-1)
- `V4_Score_Percentile__c`: Percentile rank (1-100)
- `V4_Deprioritize__c`: Boolean (TRUE if bottom 20%)

**Workflow**:
1. Query `v4_daily_scores` for leads needing scores
2. Use `LeadScorerV4` to generate predictions
3. Write scores back to Salesforce
4. SDR workflow: Skip leads where `V4_Deprioritize__c = TRUE` (unless V3 tier is T1/T2)

## Monitoring Recommendations

### Key Metrics to Track

1. **Score Distribution**:
   - Monitor percentile distribution (should be uniform 1-100)
   - Alert if distribution shifts significantly

2. **Deprioritization Impact**:
   - Track conversion rate of skipped leads (should be ~1.3%)
   - Track conversion rate of prioritized leads (should be ~3.7%)

3. **Model Drift**:
   - Compare feature distributions over time
   - Retrain if feature drift > 20%

4. **Business Impact**:
   - Track SDR time saved (leads skipped)
   - Track conversion rate improvement (top 80% vs all leads)

### Retraining Schedule

- **Quarterly**: Retrain model with latest data
- **Trigger**: If deprioritization conversion rate increases > 50%
- **Trigger**: If feature distributions shift > 20%

## Limitations & Considerations

1. **Top Decile Performance**: V4 (1.51x) does not beat V3 (1.74x) on top decile lift
   - **Solution**: Use V3 for prioritization, V4 for deprioritization

2. **Low AUC-PR**: Test AUC-PR (0.043) is below threshold (0.10)
   - **Cause**: Highly filtered dataset ("Provided Lead List" only) and low baseline conversion (2.54%)
   - **Impact**: Acceptable for deprioritization use case

3. **Feature Coverage**: Some features have high null rates
   - **Tenure**: 21.4% Unknown (improved from 97% after fix)
   - **Firm Data**: 11.7% missing
   - **Impact**: Model handles missing data via categorical encoding

4. **Sample Sizes**: Interaction features have small sample sizes
   - `mobility_x_heavy_bleeding`: 53 leads in train
   - `short_tenure_x_high_mobility`: 93 leads in train
   - **Impact**: Features still provide signal despite small samples

---

## Conclusion

**V4 is valuable as a deprioritization filter**, even though it doesn't beat V3 on top decile lift:

✅ **Strong signal**: Bottom 20% converts at 1.33% (58% below baseline)  
✅ **Efficient**: Skip 20% of leads, lose only 8.3% of conversions  
✅ **Clear separation**: Bottom deciles are well below baseline  
✅ **Hybrid value**: Use with V3 for comprehensive lead scoring

**Recommendation**: Deploy V4 as a deprioritization filter alongside V3 prioritization.
