### Recommended Tier Allocation (Based on V3.2 Distribution)

Based on available pool composition, we recommend a distribution that matches the natural V3.2 tier proportions:

| Tier | Target Count | % of List | Expected Calls | CI Lower | CI Upper |
|------|--------------|-----------|----------------|----------|----------|
| TIER_1_PRIME_MOVER | 105 | 4.67% | 16.7 | 11.9 | 21.5 |
| TIER_2_PROVEN_MOVER | 253 | 11.25% | 21.7 | 17.8 | 25.6 |
| TIER_3_MODERATE_BLEEDER | 58 | 2.58% | 5.5 | 1.9 | 9.2 |
| TIER_4_EXPERIENCED_MOVER | 52 | 2.31% | 6.0 | 3.1 | 8.9 |
| TIER_5_HEAVY_BLEEDER | 488 | 21.69% | 35.5 | 25.9 | 45.0 |
| STANDARD | 1,294 | 57.50% | 44.5 | 42.1 | 47.0 |
| **TOTAL** | **2,250** | **100%** | **109.0** | **93.0** | **126.0** |

### Expected Conversion Metrics

| Metric | Low (CI Lower) | Median | High (CI Upper) |
|--------|----------------|--------|-----------------|
| **Calls Scheduled** | 93 | 109 | 126 |
| **Conversion Rate** | 4.12% | 4.85% | 5.58% |
| **Lift vs Baseline** | 1.20x | 1.41x | 1.62x |

### Comparison to Baseline

| Scenario | Calls Expected | Rate |
|----------|----------------|------|
| Random Selection (all Standard) | 77 | 3.44% |
| V3.2 Prioritized (recommended) | 109 | **4.85%** |
| Priority Tiers Only (1-5) | Higher rate, lower volume | ~9.5% |

**Expected Improvement:** 41.6% more calls scheduled vs random selection (109 vs 77)

---

## Alternative Scenarios

### Scenario A: Priority Tiers Only (957 leads)
Focus on Tier 1-5 only (no Standard):

| Tier | Count | Expected Calls |
|------|-------|----------------|
| TIER_1_PRIME_MOVER | 105 | 16.7 |
| TIER_2_PROVEN_MOVER | 253 | 21.7 |
| TIER_3_MODERATE_BLEEDER | 58 | 5.5 |
| TIER_4_EXPERIENCED_MOVER | 52 | 6.0 |
| TIER_5_HEAVY_BLEEDER | 488 | 35.5 |
| **TOTAL** | **957** | **85.4** |

**Expected Rate:** 8.92% (95% CI: 7.25% - 10.59%)

**Use Case:** Maximum conversion rate when volume is not the constraint

### Scenario B: Top 3 Tiers Only (416 leads)
Focus on Tier 1, 2, and 4 (highest converting tiers):

| Tier | Count | Expected Calls |
|------|-------|----------------|
| TIER_1_PRIME_MOVER | 105 | 16.7 |
| TIER_2_PROVEN_MOVER | 253 | 21.7 |
| TIER_4_EXPERIENCED_MOVER | 52 | 6.0 |
| **TOTAL** | **410** | **44.4** |

**Expected Rate:** 10.83% (95% CI: 8.50% - 13.16%)

**Use Case:** Ultra-high quality, lower volume pilot test

### Scenario C: Tier 1 + Tier 4 Focus (157 leads)
Highest converting tiers only:

| Tier | Count | Expected Calls |
|------|-------|----------------|
| TIER_1_PRIME_MOVER | 105 | 16.7 |
| TIER_4_EXPERIENCED_MOVER | 52 | 6.0 |
| **TOTAL** | **157** | **22.7** |

**Expected Rate:** 14.46% (95% CI: 10.50% - 18.42%)

**Use Case:** Elite focus for highest conversion rate

### Scenario D: Maximum Volume (2,250 all Standard)
No prioritization, random selection:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Leads | 2,250 |
| Expected Calls | 77 |
| Expected Rate | **3.44%** |
| 95% CI | 3.25% - 3.63% |

**Use Case:** Baseline comparison

## Key Assumptions & Risks

### Assumptions
1. **Conversion rates from V3.2 validation (39,448 leads) apply to January 2026** - Validated on large sample, high confidence
2. **FINTRX November 2025 data is current and accurate** - Standard data freshness assumption
3. **180-day recycling window is appropriate** - Validated in previous analysis
4. **Firm stability calculations using CURRENT_DATE are representative** - May differ slightly from point-in-time calculations
5. **Tier distribution in available pool represents what we can actually source** - May need adjustment based on list availability

### Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Seasonality (January slow) | -10-20% vs baseline | Monitor weekly, adjust expectations downward |
| Market conditions change | Unknown | Use conservative CI lower bound (93 calls) |
| Recyclable leads fatigued | Lower than new prospect rates | Weight new prospects higher in sourcing |
| Firm stability calculations | May differ from PIT calculations | Validate sample before full rollout |
| Priority tier supply constraints | Can't source enough Tier 1/4 | Have fallback to Tier 2/5 tiers |

### Confidence Level
- **Tier conversion rates:** **HIGH** (based on 39,448 leads, validated conversion signals)
- **Tier distribution forecast:** **MEDIUM** (depends on pool composition, which we've measured)
- **January-specific adjustment:** **LOW** (no seasonal data analyzed, assume baseline rates)

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Use V3.2 Priority Tiers:** Validated 1.41x improvement over baseline (4.85% vs 3.44%)
2. **Prioritize New Prospects:** Much higher priority tier percentage (42.5% vs 14.1%)
3. **Target Tier 1 & 4:** Highest conversion (15.92% and 11.54%), but limited supply (4.67% and 2.31%)
4. **Leverage Tier 5:** Largest priority tier (21.69% of pool), good conversion (7.27%)
5. **Monitor Weekly:** Track actual vs expected by tier to validate assumptions
6. **Adjust Mid-Month:** If Tier 1 underperforms, shift allocation to Tier 2/5

### Sourcing Strategy
- **Week 1-2:** Focus on Tier 1 and Tier 4 (highest quality)
- **Week 3-4:** Balance with Tier 2 and Tier 5 to hit volume targets
- **Weekly Review:** Adjust tier mix based on actual performance vs forecast

### Success Metrics
- **Minimum Acceptable:** 93 calls scheduled (CI lower bound)
- **Expected:** 109 calls scheduled (median forecast)
- **Stretch Goal:** 126 calls scheduled (CI upper bound)
