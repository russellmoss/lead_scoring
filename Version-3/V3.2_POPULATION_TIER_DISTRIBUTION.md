## 🔍 Key Insights

### 1. Ultra-Rare Tiers (Tier 1A/1B)

**Tier 1A (CFP at Bleeding Firm)**: Only **44 contacts** (0.01%)
- **Extremely rare** - requires perfect combination of CFP + bleeding firm + specific tenure
- **Why so rare**: CFP certification + firm losing advisors + 1-4yr tenure + 5+yr exp + non-wirehouse
- **In Lead List**: 34 leads (77% of available Tier 1A contacts)

**Tier 1B (Series 65 Only)**: **9,160 contacts** (1.25%)
- **Rare but available** - pure RIA advisors meeting Prime Mover criteria
- **Why more common**: Series 65 only is less restrictive than CFP + bleeding firm
- **In Lead List**: 60 leads (0.65% of available Tier 1B contacts)

### 2. High-Value Tiers (Tier 1)

**Tier 1 (Prime Mover)**: **11,465 contacts** (1.56%)
- **Small but valuable** - strong conversion rate (13.21%)
- **In Lead List**: 300 leads (2.62% of available Tier 1 contacts)
- **Available for future lists**: 11,165 remaining

### 3. Volume Tiers (Tier 2)

**Tier 2 (Proven Mover)**: **131,916 contacts** (17.93%)
- **Largest priority tier** - nearly 18% of population
- **Good conversion**: 8.59% (2.5x baseline)
- **In Lead List**: 1,500 leads (1.14% of available Tier 2 contacts)
- **Available for future lists**: 130,416 remaining (massive pool)

### 4. Moderate Volume Tiers (Tiers 3-5)

**Tier 3 (Moderate Bleeder)**: **3,171 contacts** (0.43%)
- **Small volume** - firms losing 1-10 advisors
- **In Lead List**: 300 leads (9.46% of available Tier 3 contacts)

**Tier 4 (Experienced Mover)**: **19,921 contacts** (2.71%)
- **Good volume** - veterans who moved recently
- **In Lead List**: 206 leads (1.03% of available Tier 4 contacts)
- **Available for future lists**: 19,715 remaining

**Tier 5 (Heavy Bleeder)**: **3,934 contacts** (0.53%)
- **Small volume** - firms in crisis (losing 10+ advisors)
- **In Lead List**: 0 leads (0% of available Tier 5 contacts)
- **Why 0 in list**: Likely filtered out by other criteria (firm diversity cap, new/recyclable only, etc.)

### 5. Standard Tier (Baseline)

**STANDARD**: **556,109 contacts** (75.59%)
- **Vast majority** of population doesn't meet priority tier criteria
- **Baseline conversion**: 3.82%
- **Excluded from lead lists** - only priority tiers included

## 📊 Comparison: Population vs. Lead List

### Tier Distribution Comparison

| Tier | Population Count | Population % | Lead List Count | Lead List % | Utilization Rate |
|------|-----------------|--------------|-----------------|-------------|------------------|
| **Tier 1A** | 44 | 0.01% | 34 | 1.42% | **77.3%** |
| **Tier 1B** | 9,160 | 1.25% | 60 | 2.50% | **0.65%** |
| **Tier 1** | 11,465 | 1.56% | 300 | 12.50% | **2.62%** |
| **Tier 2** | 131,916 | 17.93% | 1,500 | 62.50% | **1.14%** |
| **Tier 3** | 3,171 | 0.43% | 300 | 12.50% | **9.46%** |
| **Tier 4** | 19,921 | 2.71% | 206 | 8.58% | **1.03%** |
| **Tier 5** | 3,934 | 0.53% | 0 | 0.00% | **0.00%** |
| **STANDARD** | 556,109 | 75.59% | 0 | 0.00% | **0.00%** |

**Utilization Rate** = (Lead List Count / Population Count) × 100

### Key Observations

1. **Tier 1A Highly Utilized**: 77.3% of available Tier 1A contacts are in the lead list
   - **Risk**: This tier will be exhausted quickly
   - **Recommendation**: Consider reducing Tier 1A quota to preserve for future lists

2. **Tier 1B Underutilized**: Only 0.65% of available Tier 1B contacts are in the lead list
   - **Opportunity**: 9,100+ Tier 1B contacts available for future lists
   - **Recommendation**: Could increase Tier 1B quota significantly

3. **Tier 2 Dominates Lead List**: 62.5% of lead list is Tier 2, but only 1.14% of Tier 2 population used
   - **Opportunity**: Massive pool (130K+ contacts) available
   - **Sustainability**: Tier 2 can support many future lists

4. **Tier 5 Not Utilized**: 0% of Tier 5 contacts in lead list
   - **Issue**: Tier 5 contacts exist but don't meet lead list criteria
   - **Investigation Needed**: Why are Tier 5 contacts filtered out?

## 📈 Lead List Sustainability Analysis

### How Many Lists Can We Generate?

Assuming 2,400 leads per list and current tier quotas:

| Tier | Available Contacts | Current Quota | Lists Supported | Notes |
|------|-------------------|---------------|-----------------|-------|
| **Tier 1A** | 44 | 30 | **1.5 lists** | ⚠️ **Will exhaust quickly** |
| **Tier 1B** | 9,160 | 60 | **152 lists** | ✅ **Highly sustainable** |
| **Tier 1** | 11,465 | 300 | **38 lists** | ✅ **Sustainable** |
| **Tier 2** | 131,916 | 1,500 | **88 lists** | ✅ **Very sustainable** |
| **Tier 3** | 3,171 | 300 | **10 lists** | ⚠️ **Limited sustainability** |
| **Tier 4** | 19,921 | 206 | **97 lists** | ✅ **Sustainable** |
| **Tier 5** | 3,934 | 0 | **N/A** | ❓ **Not being used** |

**Bottleneck**: Tier 1A will be exhausted after ~1.5 lists (if quota stays at 30)

**Recommendation**: Reduce Tier 1A quota to 15-20 per list to extend sustainability to 2-3 lists

---

## 🔍 Tier 5 Investigation

**Question**: Why are 0 Tier 5 contacts in the lead list when 3,934 exist in the population?

**Possible Reasons**:
1. **Firm Diversity Cap**: Tier 5 contacts may be concentrated in a few firms (50 leads/firm cap)
2. **New/Recyclable Filter**: Tier 5 contacts may not be new prospects or recyclable (180+ days)
3. **Wirehouse Exclusion**: Some Tier 5 contacts may be at wirehouses
4. **Collapsed Firm Exclusion**: Firms with >100% turnover excluded
5. **Other Filters**: May not meet other lead list criteria

**Action Needed**: Investigate why Tier 5 contacts are filtered out to potentially increase lead list volume

---

## 💡 Recommendations

### 1. Adjust Tier Quotas for Sustainability

**Current Quotas** (from lead list):
- Tier 1A: 30 → **Reduce to 15-20** (preserve rare tier)
- Tier 1B: 60 → **Could increase to 100-150** (plenty available)
- Tier 1: 300 → **Keep at 300** (good balance)
- Tier 2: 1,500 → **Keep at 1,500** (massive pool available)
- Tier 3: 300 → **Reduce to 200** (limited availability)
- Tier 4: 206 → **Could increase to 300** (plenty available)
- Tier 5: 0 → **Investigate and potentially add 200-300** (3,934 available)

### 2. Investigate Tier 5 Exclusion

**Action Items**:
1. Query Tier 5 contacts to see why they're filtered out
2. Check if firm diversity cap is the issue
3. Check if new/recyclable filter is too restrictive
4. Consider relaxing filters for Tier 5 if needed

### 3. Monitor Tier 1A Exhaustion

**Risk**: Tier 1A will be exhausted after 1-2 lists
**Mitigation**: 
- Reduce Tier 1A quota to 15-20 per list
- Or: Blend Tier 1A into Tier 1 after exhaustion

### 4. Leverage Tier 2 Volume

**Opportunity**: Tier 2 has 131K+ contacts available
**Strategy**: 
- Tier 2 can support 88+ lists at current quota
- Consider Tier 2 as primary volume tier
- Maintain 1,500 quota for consistency

| **Tier 1A** | 44 | 7.2 | 16.44% |
| **Tier 1B** | 9,160 | 1,509.6 | 16.48% |
| **Tier 1** | 11,465 | 1,514.5 | 13.21% |
| **Tier 2** | 131,916 | 11,321.6 | 8.59% |
| **Tier 3** | 3,171 | 302.1 | 9.52% |
| **Tier 4** | 19,921 | 2,298.9 | 11.54% |
| **Tier 5** | 3,934 | 286.0 | 7.27% |
| **STANDARD** | 556,109 | 21,243.4 | 3.82% |
| **TOTAL** | **735,720** | **38,483.3** | **5.23%** |

**Key Insight**: Priority tiers (1-5) represent 24.41% of population but would generate 44.6% of conversions if all were contacted.

- Includes firm metrics (bleeding, size, turnover)
- Includes advisor history (mobility, tenure, experience)

### Exclusions
- **Wirehouses**: Excluded from priority tiers (but counted in population)
