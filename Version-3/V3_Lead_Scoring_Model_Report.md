# Lead Scoring Model V3: Transforming Provided Lead Lists
## SGA Intelligence Meets Mathematical Validation

---

## Executive Summary

**The Challenge:** Our provided lead lists were underperforming self-sourced LinkedIn leads, with SGAs reporting lower engagement and conversion rates (3.82% baseline).

**The Solution:** We interviewed top-performing SGAs (Russell, Eleni, Perry) to understand what makes self-sourced leads convert, then validated their insights against 3 years of historical data (47,860 leads) to create a sophisticated tier-based scoring model.

**The Result:** V3 model with **7 priority tiers** that identify leads converting at **2.0x to 4.3x baseline**, with the top tier achieving **16.4% conversion** - matching the performance of top SGA self-sourced leads.

**Expected Impact:** Provided lead lists will now include 164+ priority leads (out of 2,400) that convert at rates comparable to self-sourced leads, dramatically improving SGA efficiency and satisfaction.

## Methodology: From SGA Interviews to Mathematical Validation

### Phase 1: Qualitative Research - SGA Interviews (Nov 24-25, 2025)

We conducted detailed interviews with our top-performing SGAs to understand **why** their self-sourced leads convert better than provided lists.

#### Key Participants
- **Russell Armitage** - Specialist in founder-led RIAs
- **Eleni Stephanopoulos** - Expert in small independent RIAs  
- **Perry Kalmeta** - Data-driven sourcing with advanced verification

#### Critical Insights Extracted

| SGA | Key Targeting Criteria | Why It Works |
|-----|----------------------|--------------|
| **Russell** | "Founder and wealth advisor" keyword searches | Founders own their book (no restrictive covenants) |
| **Eleni** | CFP job title, 4-10 years tenure at small RIAs | CFP = book ownership, 4-10yr = portable but established |
| **Perry** | Series 7 skills filter, avoid "helped manage portfolio" language | Series 7 = client-facing, "helped manage" = doesn't own book |

#### Key Signals Identified

Through systematic analysis of SGA interviews, we identified **10 critical signals** that predict conversion:

| Signal Category | Specific Indicators | SGA Source |
|----------------|---------------------|------------|
| **Book Ownership** | CFP certification, "Founder" in title, Series 65 only | All 3 SGAs |
| **Portability** | 4-10 years tenure, small firm size (<50 reps) | Eleni, Russell |
| **Mobility History** | Prior firm changes, career movers (3+ firms) | Perry |
| **Firm Instability** | Firm losing advisors, "bleeding" signals | Russell |
| **Career Stage** | Mid-career (5-15 years exp), veterans who moved (20+ years) | All 3 SGAs |
| **Firm Type** | Independent RIAs, avoid wirehouses | Eleni, Perry |
| **Client-Facing** | Series 7 license, avoid "helped manage" language | Perry |
| **Age/Retirement** | 30-60 years old (avoid near-retirement) | Eleni |
| **Engagement** | 500+ LinkedIn connections, active profiles | Perry |
| **Accreditations** | CDFA (divorce specialist), CFA (with caveats) | Perry |

---

### Phase 2: Mathematical Validation - Historical Data Analysis

We took the SGA insights and tested them against **3 years of historical lead data** (2022-2025, 47,860 leads) to see if the math supported the qualitative findings.

#### Comprehensive Signal Validation Results

| Segment Tested | Count | Conversion Rate | Lift vs Baseline | Validated? |
|----------------|-------|----------------|------------------|-----------|
| **CFP at Bleeding Firm** | 73 | **16.44%** | **4.30x** | ✅ Yes |
| **Series 65 Only + Prime Mover** | 91 | **16.48%** | **4.31x** | ✅ Yes |
| **Small Bleeding Firm (<50 reps)** | 30 | **26.67%** | **7.29x** | ✅ Yes |
| **Very Small Firm (<10 reps)** | 104 | **14.42%** | **3.94x** | ✅ Yes |
| **Career Movers (3+ firms)** | 1,155 | **9.00%** | **2.46x** | ✅ Yes |
| **Moderate Bleeding Firm** | 75 | **9.33%** | **2.55x** | ✅ Yes |
| **Veteran Recent Movers (20+ yr exp)** | 117 | **11.97%** | **3.27x** | ✅ Yes |
| **Heavy Bleeding Firm (10+ departures)** | 623 | **7.38%** | **2.02x** | ✅ Yes |
| CFP Alone (no context) | 1,247 | 3.89% | 1.02x | ❌ No |
| Baseline (all other leads) | 46,204 | 3.82% | 1.00x | Baseline |

#### Key Mathematical Findings

1. **Context Matters**: CFP alone shows no signal (3.89%), but CFP + bleeding firm shows exceptional performance (16.44%)

2. **Small Firms = Gold**: Firms with ≤50 reps show 3.5-7x lift depending on other signals

3. **Mobility Signals Work**: Advisors who've moved 3+ times convert at 2.5x baseline

4. **Statistical Significance**: All priority tiers have 95% confidence intervals that don't overlap with baseline

5. **Combination Signals Strongest**: Best performance comes from combining multiple signals (e.g., CFP + bleeding firm, Series 65 + small firm)

---

## The V3 Model: 7-Tier Intelligent Prioritization System

Based on SGA intelligence + mathematical validation, we created a tier system that captures the nuanced combinations of signals that predict conversion.

### Complete Tier Structure & Signal Combinations

| Tier | Key Signals | Conversion Rate | Lift | Priority Rank |
|------|------------|----------------|------|---------------|
| **Tier 1A: Prime Mover + CFP** | CFP cert + Bleeding firm + 1-4yr tenure + 5+ yr exp | **16.44%** | **4.30x** | 1 (Highest) |
| **Tier 1B: Prime Mover + Series 65** | Series 65 only + Prime mover signals | **16.48%** | **4.31x** | 2 |
| **Tier 1: Prime Mover** | Small bleeding firm OR very small firm OR original prime mover | **13.21%** | **3.46x** | 3 |
| **Tier 2: Proven Mover** | 3+ prior firms + 5+ yr exp | **8.59%** | **2.50x** | 4 |
| **Tier 3: Moderate Bleeder** | Firm losing 1-10 advisors + 5+ yr exp | **9.52%** | **2.77x** | 5 |
| **Tier 4: Experienced Mover** | 20+ yr exp + moved in last 4 years | **11.54%** | **3.35x** | 6 |
| **Tier 5: Heavy Bleeder** | Firm losing 10+ advisors + 5+ yr exp | **7.27%** | **2.11x** | 7 |
| **Standard** | All other leads | 3.82% | 1.00x | 8 |

### How Signals Combine in Each Tier

#### Tier 1A: Prime Mover + CFP (Highest Priority)

**Signal Combination:**
- ✅ **CFP certification** (from FINTRX bio/title) - "by far the most important accreditation" (Perry)
- ✅ **Bleeding firm** (firm losing advisors) - instability signal
- ✅ **1-4 years tenure** - Eleni's "sweet spot where clients are loyal enough to move"
- ✅ **5+ years experience** - established but not entrenched
- ✅ **Not wirehouse** - portability requirement

**Why This Works:**
- CFP = book ownership indicator (Perry: "CFP is by far the most important")
- Bleeding firm = advisor likely evaluating options
- Mid-tenure = portable but established (Russell: "own their book")

**Mathematical Evidence:**
- 73 historical leads, 16.44% conversion, 4.30x lift
- 95% CI: 7.5% - 25.4% (no overlap with baseline)

---

#### Tier 1B: Prime Mover + Series 65 Only

**Signal Combination:**
- ✅ **Series 65 WITHOUT Series 7** - pure RIA (no broker-dealer ties)
- ✅ **Meets Prime Mover criteria** (small bleeding firm OR very small firm OR standard prime mover)
- ✅ **Not wirehouse**

**Why This Works:**
- Series 65 only = fee-only RIA (Perry: "filters for Series 7... avoids 'helped manage'")
- No BD registration = easier to move (no commission business)
- Eleni: "Looks for advisors who moved from large firms to an RIA"

**Mathematical Evidence:**
- 91 historical leads, 16.48% conversion, 4.31x lift
- 95% CI: 8.6% - 24.4% (no overlap with baseline)

---

#### Tier 1: Prime Mover (Three Paths)

**Path A: Small Bleeding Firm**
- ✅ 1-3 years tenure (tightened from 1-4)
- ✅ 5-15 years experience
- ✅ Bleeding firm (losing advisors)
- ✅ ≤50 reps (small firm size)

**Path B: Very Small Firm**
- ✅ 1-3 years tenure
- ✅ ≤10 reps (micro firm)
- (No bleeding requirement - small size is signal enough)

**Path C: Original Prime Mover**
- ✅ 1-4 years tenure
- ✅ 5-15 years experience
- ✅ Bleeding firm

**Why This Works:**
- Eleni: "4-10 years at current firm... after 4, clients are loyal enough to move"
- Russell: "Self-employed and 1-10 employees (owners with portable books)"
- Small firms = more portable client relationships

**Mathematical Evidence:**
- 245 historical leads, 13.21% conversion, 3.46x lift
- 95% CI: 8.9% - 17.5% (no overlap with baseline)

---

#### Tier 2: Proven Mover

**Signal Combination:**
- ✅ **3+ prior firms** - career mobility history
- ✅ **5+ years experience** - established professional
- ✅ **Not wirehouse**

**Why This Works:**
- Perry: "Ideal advisor: someone at an RIA for 7-8+ years who has prior experience elsewhere"
- Demonstrates willingness to change when opportunity appears
- Largest priority tier = good volume (1,281 leads)

**Mathematical Evidence:**
- 1,281 historical leads, 8.59% conversion, 2.50x lift

---

#### Tier 3: Moderate Bleeder

**Signal Combination:**
- ✅ **Firm losing 1-10 advisors** (moderate instability)
- ✅ **5+ years experience** - experienced enough to be portable

**Why This Works:**
- When firm loses several advisors, remaining advisors evaluate options
- Not crisis-level bleeding, but enough instability to trigger movement

**Mathematical Evidence:**
- 84 historical leads, 9.52% conversion, 2.77x lift

---

#### Tier 4: Experienced Mover

**Signal Combination:**
- ✅ **20+ years experience** - veteran advisor
- ✅ **1-4 years tenure** - recently moved

**Why This Works:**
- Veterans who moved recently have broken inertia
- Demonstrates they will move for right opportunity
- Russell: "3-20 years at current company; 8-30 years total experience"

**Mathematical Evidence:**
- 130 historical leads, 11.54% conversion, 3.35x lift

---

#### Tier 5: Heavy Bleeder

**Signal Combination:**
- ✅ **Firm losing 10+ advisors** (crisis mode)
- ✅ **5+ years experience** - experienced enough to be portable

**Why This Works:**
- Firm in crisis, advisors likely actively looking
- Large volume tier (674 leads) with solid 2x lift

**Mathematical Evidence:**
- 674 historical leads, 7.27% conversion, 2.11x lift

## How We Prioritize & Sort Leads

### Multi-Dimensional Ranking System

The V3 model uses a sophisticated sorting algorithm that considers **three dimensions**:

#### 1. Tier Priority (Primary Sort)
```
Tier 1A (Rank 1) → Tier 1B (Rank 2) → Tier 1 (Rank 3) → Tier 2 (Rank 4) → 
Tier 3 (Rank 5) → Tier 4 (Rank 6) → Tier 5 (Rank 7) → Standard (Rank 8)
```

#### 2. Prospect Source (Secondary Sort)
```
New Prospects (not in Salesforce) → Recyclable Leads (180+ days inactive)
```

**Why New Prospects First:**
- Fresh leads, never contacted
- Higher engagement potential
- No contact fatigue

**Recyclable Leads:**
- In Salesforce but 180+ days since last SMS/Call
- No-shows, no-connects, or old leads
- Second chance at conversion

#### 3. Firm Instability (Tertiary Sort)
```
Within same tier: Sort by firm_net_change_12mo (most negative first)
```

**Why Bleeding Severity Matters:**
- Firm losing 15 advisors > firm losing 5 advisors
- More instability = more urgency
- Validates Russell's targeting of unstable firms

### Complete Ranking Formula

```sql
sort_score = 
    (CASE WHEN new_prospect THEN 0 ELSE 1000 END)  -- New prospects first
    + (priority_rank * 100)                         -- Tier priority
    + (ABS(firm_net_change_12mo) * -1)             -- Bleeding severity (more negative = higher priority)
```

**Example Rankings:**

| Lead Profile | Tier | Source | Firm Change | Sort Score | Final Rank |
|--------------|------|--------|-------------|------------|------------|
| CFP at firm losing 20 advisors | 1A | New | -20 | 0 + 100 + (-20) = 80 | 1st |
| Series 65 at firm losing 15 advisors | 1B | New | -15 | 0 + 200 + (-15) = 185 | 2nd |
| Prime mover at firm losing 10 advisors | 1 | New | -10 | 0 + 300 + (-10) = 290 | 3rd |
| CFP at firm losing 5 advisors | 1A | Recyclable | -5 | 1000 + 100 + (-5) = 1,095 | After new prospects |

---

## Additional Quality Controls

### Firm Diversity Cap

**Rule:** Maximum **50 leads per firm** in any single list

**Why This Matters:**
- Prevents over-concentration on single firms
- Ensures broad market coverage
- Reduces risk if one firm stops responding

**SGA Feedback Addressed:**
- Russell: Targets diverse founder-led firms, not concentrated lists
- Eleni: "Small independent RIAs" - implies variety, not concentration

### Wirehouse Exclusion

**Excluded Firms:** 30+ patterns including Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, UBS, Wells Fargo, Edward Jones, Fidelity, Schwab, Vanguard, and more

**Why This Matters:**
- Perry: "Banks - avoided because the bank owns the client relationship, not the advisor"
- Eleni: "Filters for 'Wealth Management' or 'Advisors' in name to exclude wirehouses"
- 11,278 wirehouse leads excluded from priority tiers

### Mobile Number Verification

**Process:** Pre-verified mobile numbers from FINTRX (cross-referenced with SignalHire)

**SGA Feedback Addressed:**
- "Lists require extensive 'recycling' (e.g., finding mobile numbers for landlines)"
- Perry: "Uses SignalHire to cross-reference mobile numbers"
- Reduces SGA time spent on data cleanup

---

## Expected Impact on Provided Lead Lists

### Current State (Pre-V3)

| Metric | Value | SGA Feedback |
|--------|-------|--------------|
| **List Quality** | 3.82% baseline conversion | "Lists don't filter for activity, leading to lower engagement" |
| **SGA Satisfaction** | Low - SGAs prefer self-sourcing | "Lists require extensive 'recycling'" |
| **Signal Capture** | 0% - generic targeting | CFP/Series 65/mobility signals ignored |
| **Firm Diversity** | No cap - over-concentration risk | No systematic diversity control |

### Future State (With V3)

#### January 2026 Lead List Actual Distribution (2,400 Total Leads)

**Note:** STANDARD tier leads are excluded - only priority tiers with proven lift (2.0x to 4.3x baseline) are included.

**Tier 5 (Heavy Bleeder) Note:** 0 leads available in this tier. This is likely due to the combination of strict criteria (firm losing 10+ advisors) with other filters (firm diversity cap of 50 leads/firm, new prospects or recyclable only, wirehouse exclusion, collapsed firm exclusion). Heavy Bleeder leads may exist in the database but don't meet all filtering criteria simultaneously.

| Tier | Actual Count | Percentage | Expected Conversions | Conversion Rate |
|------|-------------|------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| **Tier 1A (CFP at bleeding firm)** | **34 leads** | 1.42% | **5.6 conversions** | 16.44% |
| **Tier 1B (Series 65 only)** | **60 leads** | 2.50% | **9.9 conversions** | 16.48% |
| **Tier 1 (Prime Mover)** | **300 leads** | 12.50% | **39.6 conversions** | 13.21% |
| **Tier 2 (Proven Mover)** | **1,500 leads** | 62.50% | **128.9 conversions** | 8.59% |
| **Tier 3 (Moderate Bleeder)** | **300 leads** | 12.50% | **28.6 conversions** | 9.52% |
| **Tier 4 (Experienced Mover)** | **206 leads** | 8.58% | **23.8 conversions** | 11.54% |
| **Tier 5 (Heavy Bleeder)** | **0 leads** | 0.00% | **0 conversions** | 7.27% |
| **Standard** | **0 leads** | 0.00% | **0 conversions** | 3.82% |
| **TOTAL** | **2,400 leads** | **100.00%** | **~236 conversions** | **9.83%** |

#### Comparison to Random List (No Scoring)

| Metric | Random List | V3 Scored List (Actual) | Improvement |
|--------|-------------|------------------------|-------------|
| **Expected Conversions** | 91.7 (3.82%) | **236.0 (9.83%)** | **+157.4%** |
| **Ultra-Priority Leads (Tier 1A/1B)** | 0 | **94 leads** | New segment |
| **Priority Tier Leads (All Tiers 1-5)** | 0 | **2,400 leads** | 100% of list (STANDARD excluded) |
| **SGA Efficiency** | Low (3.82% hit rate) | **High (9.83% hit rate)** | **+157.4% efficiency** |

## Why This Will Work: Alignment with SGA Best Practices

### The SGA Sourcing Playbook vs V3 Model

| SGA Best Practice | How V3 Captures This | Mathematical Evidence |
|-------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **Target founders/book owners** | CFP certification, "Founder" signals | 16.44% conversion (4.3x baseline) |
| **Filter for pure RIAs** | Series 65 only (no BD ties) | 16.48% conversion (4.3x baseline) |
| **Small firms = portability** | Firm size filters (≤50 reps, ≤10 reps) | 13.21-26.67% conversion (3.5-7x baseline) |
| **4-10 year tenure sweet spot** | 1-4 year tenure tiers | Validated across Tiers 1A/1B/1 |
| **Target career movers** | Tier 2: 3+ prior firms | 8.59% conversion (2.5x baseline) |
| **Avoid wirehouses** | Explicit wirehouse exclusion | 11,278 leads filtered out |
| **Verify mobile numbers** | Pre-validated in list generation | Reduces SGA "recycling" work |
| **Target instability** | Firm bleeding signals (Tiers 1/3/5) | 7-16% conversion rates |
| **Veterans who moved** | Tier 4: 20+ yr exp, recent move | 11.54% conversion (3.3x baseline) |
| **Age/retirement filter** | Implicit in 5-15yr, 20+yr exp tiers | Avoids near-retirement advisors |

### What SGAs Will Notice

**Immediately (Week 1):**
- Lists include **CFP** and **Series 65** advisors they would self-source
- **Small RIA** advisors (≤50 reps) prominently featured
- **Career movers** (3+ firms) identified in Tier 2
- Mobile numbers pre-verified (less recycling)
- Firm diversity ensures variety (48+ unique firms per list)

**Within 30 Days:**
- Higher response rates from **Tier 1A/1B** leads (16%+ conversion expected)
- Better engagement from **Tier 1** small firm advisors (13% conversion)
- Solid volume from **Tier 2** proven movers (600+ leads at 8.6% conversion)
- Fewer "dead end" leads (wirehouses excluded, numbers verified)

---

## One-Month Follow-Up Plan: SGA Feedback Loop

### Week 1: List Deployment
- **Action:** Deploy January 2026 lead list (2,400 leads) to SGAs
- **Communication:** Present this report to SGAs explaining the tier structure and signal logic
- **Expectation Setting:** "These lists now include the same profiles you self-source, ranked by our 7-tier system"

### Week 2-4: Active Monitoring

**Metrics to Track:**

| Metric Category | Specific Metrics | Why It Matters |
|----------------|------------------|----------------|
| **Tier Performance** | Response rate by tier (1A, 1B, 1, 2-5) | Validates mathematical model |
| **Conversion Rates** | Contacted-to-MQL by tier | Core success metric |
| **SGA Behavior** | % of each tier contacted | Shows SGA trust in tiers |
| **Time Savings** | Minutes/week spent recycling leads | Should decrease |
| **Lead Quality** | "Dead end" rate (landlines, bad numbers) | Should decrease |
| **Engagement** | Response time, meeting booking rates | Should improve |

### Week 4: SGA Feedback Session

#### Structured Interview Questions

**Quantitative Feedback:**
1. "What % of Tier 1A/1B leads did you contact? Tier 1? Tier 2-5?"
2. "What was your response rate for each tier?"
3. "How much time did you spend finding mobile numbers compared to previous lists?"
4. "What % of leads were 'dead ends' (bad numbers, landlines, unresponsive)?"

**Qualitative Feedback:**
1. "Did Tier 1A/1B leads feel different from previous lists? How?"
2. "Which tier performed better than expected? Worse than expected?"
3. "What signals are we still missing that you look for when self-sourcing?"
4. "Did the firm diversity cap (50 leads/firm) help or hurt your workflow?"
5. "How did the tier explanations (narratives) help you in your outreach?"

#### Success Metrics (What We're Looking For)

| Metric | Target | Why This Matters |
|--------|--------|------------------|
| **Tier 1A/1B Conversion** | ≥14% | Validates CFP/Series 65 signals (94 leads available) |
| **Tier 1 Conversion** | ≥11% | Validates small firm/prime mover logic (300 leads available) |
| **Tier 2-5 Aggregate Conversion** | ≥7% | Validates broader signal set (2,006 leads available) |
| **Overall List Conversion** | ≥9% | Should exceed 3.82% baseline (actual projection: 9.83%) |
| **SGA Satisfaction** | "Better than previous lists" | Indicates we're capturing self-sourced profiles |
| **Time Saved** | <30 min/week recycling | Pre-verified numbers reduce work |
| **Self-Sourcing %** | Decrease by 10-20% | SGAs rely more on provided lists |

---

## Risk Mitigation & Contingency Plans

### Potential Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|-------------|--------|---------------------|
| **Tier 1A/1B sample size too small** | Low | Low | Actual: 94 leads (34 Tier 1A + 60 Tier 1B) - sufficient volume |
| **CFP detection accuracy** | Low | Low | Validated on 47,860 leads, cross-referenced with FINTRX bio/title data |
| **Series 65 detection accuracy** | Low | Low | License data from FINTRX highly reliable (regulatory reporting) |
| **SGAs don't notice difference** | Low | High | Clear communication + tier narratives in each lead + this presentation |
| **Tier 2 volume too high** | Medium | Low | Proven movers are solid 2.5x lift - high volume is actually good |
| **Firm diversity cap too restrictive** | Low | Medium | Can adjust to 75 leads/firm if needed |

### Contingency Plan

**If Overall List Underperforms (Week 4 review shows <5% conversion):**

1. **Diagnose the Issue:**
   - Are SGAs contacting priority tiers? (Behavior issue)
   - Are leads responding? (Signal issue)
   - Are conversions happening later? (Timing issue)

2. **Tier-Specific Adjustments:**
   - **Tier 1A/1B underperforms:** Tighten firm bleeding criteria (require -5 or more departures)
   - **Tier 1 underperforms:** Adjust firm size threshold (try ≤75 reps instead of ≤50)
   - **Tier 2 underperforms:** Increase minimum prior firms to 4+

3. **Expand Signal Set:**
   - Add **CDFA** certification (Perry: "strong indicator of client-facing experience")
   - Add **firm size growth** signals (firms actively recruiting)
   - Add **LinkedIn engagement** filters (500+ connections)

4. **Adjust Firm Diversity Cap:**
   - Increase to 75 leads/firm if volume is issue
   - Or: Create "super firms" tier with different cap

## Expected Business Impact

### Conversion Improvement Projections

#### Scenario Analysis: 2,400 Lead List

| Scenario | Conversions | Improvement vs Random | Notes |
|----------|-------------|----------------------|-------|
| **Random List (No Scoring)** | 91.7 (3.82%) | Baseline | Current state |
| **V3 Actual Distribution** | **236.0 (9.83%)** | **+157.4%** | Actual with STANDARD tier excluded |
| **V3 + SGA Focus on Top Tiers** | **260+ conversions** | **+184%** | If SGAs prioritize Tier 1A/1B/1 (394 leads) |
| **Conservative Case (20% below expected)** | 188.8 (7.9%) | **+106%** | Still strong improvement |

### SGA Efficiency Gains

- **Better prioritization:** SGAs focus on 16% converters (Tier 1A/1B) instead of 3.82% baseline
- **Fewer dead ends:** Wirehouse exclusion + mobile verification

**Contact Efficiency:**
- **From 3.82% to 9.83% hit rate:** +157.4% improvement (actual with STANDARD excluded)
- **Top tier focus:** If SGAs prioritize Tiers 1A/1B/1, can achieve 13-16% conversion on 394 leads

**Satisfaction Improvements:**
- Lists now match self-sourced quality (CFP, Series 65, small firms)
- Less frustration with "dead end" leads
- More time for relationship building vs. lead hunting

### Volume × Quality Matrix

| Tier Group | Volume | Conversion | Expected MQLs | Quality Rating |
|------------|--------|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| **Ultra-Priority (1A/1B)** | 94 leads | 16.4% | 15.4 MQLs | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Exceptional |
| **High Priority (Tier 1)** | 300 leads | 13.2% | 39.6 MQLs | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Excellent |
| **Medium Priority (Tiers 2-4)** | 2,006 leads | 8-12% | 181.3 MQLs | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Very Good |
| **Tier 5 (Heavy Bleeder)** | 0 leads | 7.27% | 0 MQLs | N/A (no leads available) |
| **Standard** | 0 leads | 3.82% | 0 MQLs | Excluded from list |

## Conclusion: From SGA Intelligence to Mathematical Certainty

### What We Learned

**From SGAs (Qualitative):**
- CFP and Series 65 certifications are strongest signals of book ownership
- Small firms (<50 reps) have more portable advisors
- Career movers (3+ firms) demonstrate willingness to change
- Firm instability (bleeding) triggers advisor evaluation
- 4-10 year tenure is "sweet spot" for portability
- Pure RIAs (Series 65 only) easier to recruit than dual-registered

**From Data (Quantitative):**
- 16.44% conversion for CFP at bleeding firms (4.3x baseline)
- 16.48% conversion for Series 65 only advisors (4.3x baseline)
- 13.21% conversion for standard prime movers (3.5x baseline)
- 8.59% conversion for career movers (2.5x baseline)
- All 7 priority tiers validated with statistical significance (95% CIs)

### The V3 Difference

**Previous Lists:**
- ❌ Generic targeting (3.82% conversion)
- ❌ No signal prioritization
- ❌ Required extensive SGA recycling
- ❌ Low SGA satisfaction

**V3 Lists:**
- ✅ 7-tier intelligent prioritization (6.75% expected conversion)
- ✅ 10+ signals validated mathematically
- ✅ Pre-verified mobile numbers
- ✅ Firm diversity controls
- ✅ Matches SGA self-sourced profiles

### The Promise

**To SGAs:** Your provided lists will now include the same high-quality profiles you self-source (CFP, Series 65, small firms, career movers), ranked by a 7-tier system that tells you exactly why each lead is prioritized.

**To Leadership:** We've transformed our lead lists from generic databases to precision-targeted pools that convert at **76.5%+ higher rates**, backed by both SGA expertise and mathematical validation across 47,860 historical leads.

### The Path Forward

1. **Deploy V3 lists** starting January 2026 (2,400 leads)
2. **Track performance** for 30 days with active monitoring
3. **Gather SGA feedback** through structured interviews (Week 4)
4. **Iterate based on results** - adjust thresholds, add new signals, refine tiers

**The commitment:** We will listen to SGA feedback at the 30-day mark and continuously improve the model based on real-world performance data.
