## Confidence Interval Analysis

### Tier 1 (Prime Mover)
- **95% CI:** 11.34% - 20.50%
- **Width:** 9.16 percentage points
- **Interpretation:** With 95% confidence, the true conversion rate for Tier 1 leads is between 11.34% and 20.50%. The lower bound (11.34%) is still 3.5x the baseline upper bound (3.63%), confirming strong statistical significance.

### Tier 2 (Proven Mover)
- **95% CI:** 7.05% - 10.12%
- **Width:** 3.07 percentage points
- **Interpretation:** Narrow confidence interval due to large sample size (1,281 leads). Even the lower bound (7.05%) is 2.17x the baseline upper bound.

### Tier 3 (Moderate Bleeder)
- **95% CI:** 3.25% - 15.80%
- **Width:** 12.55 percentage points
- **Interpretation:** Wide confidence interval due to small sample size (84 leads). However, the midpoint (9.52%) is well above baseline, and the lower bound still overlaps with baseline upper bound, indicating some uncertainty but still positive signal.

### Tier 4 (Experienced Mover)
- **95% CI:** 6.05% - 17.03%
- **Width:** 10.98 percentage points
- **Interpretation:** Strong performance with lower bound (6.05%) still 1.86x the baseline upper bound.

### Tier 5 (Heavy Bleeder)
- **95% CI:** 5.31% - 9.23%
- **Width:** 3.92 percentage points
- **Interpretation:** Moderate performance with good precision due to larger sample size (674 leads).

- **Priority Tiers Only:** ~9.15% conversion (weighted average)
- **Tier 1 Only:** 15.92% conversion
- **Improvement:** 2.66x better than random selection when using all priority tiers, 4.63x better when focusing on Tier 1
