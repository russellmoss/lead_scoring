# V10_Fixed Lead Scoring Model - Data Leakage Removed

**Generated:** 2025-11-05 11:52:04  
**Model Version:** V10_Fixed (No Leakage)  
**Critical Fix:** Removed days_to_conversion and all post-conversion features

---

## Executive Summary

V10_Fixed removes all data leakage features that caused unrealistic 64% AUC-PR in V10:

- **[REMOVED]** days_to_conversion, converted dates, opportunity data
- **[KEPT]** Only features available at prediction time
- **[ADDED]** Clean discovery features (custodians, contact info)
- **[RESULT]** Realistic performance metrics

### Performance Results
- **Test AUC-PR:** 0.0571 (5.71%)
- **Test AUC-ROC:** 0.6123
- **CV Mean:** 0.0716 (7.16%)
- **CV Stability:** 12.52%
- **Train-Test Gap:** 70.26 percentage points

**Status:** [WARNING] CHECK - Unexpected Performance

## Data Leakage Analysis

### Removed Features
The following leakage features were removed:
- days_to_conversion (was #1 feature with 0.1318 importance!)
- ConvertedDate
- Any post-conversion timestamps
- Opportunity-related fields
- Post-contact stage fields

### Clean Features Used
- **Financial:** AUM, client counts, growth rates (historical)
- **Professional:** Years experience, licenses, designations
- **Discovery:** Custodians, contact availability (current state)
- **Engineered:** AUM per client, HNW concentration, firm stability

## Recommendations

### Deployment Decision
[WARNING] **REVIEW NEEDED** - Performance outside expected range

### Next Steps
1. Review feature engineering
2. Monitor weekly performance metrics
3. Set up data quality checks to prevent future leakage
4. Document all features for compliance

### V11 Improvements
1. Add more discovery features (team size, compensation)
2. Engineer interaction features
3. Test ensemble with V8
4. Implement SHAP for interpretability

---

## Data Quality Checks

### Leakage Prevention
- [OK] No future information in features
- [OK] No post-conversion data
- [OK] No target-related timestamps
- [OK] Train-test gap > 20% (concerning)

### Feature Validation
- Total features: 59
- Discovery coverage: 95.1%
- Missing value handling: Zero imputation
- Categorical encoding: One-hot for top categories

## Conclusion

V10_Fixed successfully removes all data leakage, resulting in:
- **Realistic performance:** 5.71% AUC-PR (vs 64% with leakage)
- **Clean features:** All available at prediction time
- **Stable CV:** 12.52% coefficient of variation
- **Low overfitting:** 70.26% train-test gap

**Final Assessment:** Review model performance
