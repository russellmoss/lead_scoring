In order to pull new discovery data you need to 
1. Go to discovery data
2. In reports you will see t1, t2, t3
3. For eachh: 
3a. click view list -> Open in RIA Reps
3b. Click download -> all fields available

I would also recommend uploading a list of all the Rep CRDs in SF and pulling a custom report from Discovery Data in order to boost the match rate
